          The Department was founded in 2007 replacing the more broadly based Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. 

          The Department is chaired by Steven A. Siegelbaum, PhD, Professor of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, and includes 35 faculty members. Among them are:
          - two **Nobel Prize** winners **Eric Kandel** (2000) and **Richard Axel** (2004)

          - eight members of the National Academy of Sciences
          - 13 members of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies

          The textbook **Principles of Neural Science**, which counts numerous Columbia faculty as co-authors, is the most widely used neuroscience text in the world.
