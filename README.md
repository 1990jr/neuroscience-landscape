### Basic Facts and Concepts

* Brain is not a _randomly_ connected mesh, there is low and high level structure
* _Grey matter_ â€” surface layer, cortex, mostly neurons, ~6 layers of neurons, for other animals less, varies by area
* _White matter_ â€” insides, connections between neurons, moslty axons
* _Occurent information_ â€” current representation, vector at layer in network, what is being processed now
* _Abeyant information_ â€” stored representation, weights at layer of network
* _Local conding_ - each neuron represents information; "Grandmother" is a single neuron
* _Distributed coding_ - multiple neurons involved in represeting information; "Grandmother" is distributed on many neurons
* _Connectomics_ - given brain is a graph what are it's properties, how it differs by animal, how it comes to being and changes with time. Fully mappend connectoms are for: C elegans, Drosophilia, Fly. Pigeon brain is good coverage, but not full. Monkey, humans not copmlete but at lot is mapped. A lot, but not all, structure of connectome and weights is encoded in genes.
* _Plasticity_ - how neurons change their connection weights: structural plasticity - changing what is connected; functional plasticity - changing strength and qualities of connections.
* _Translational neuroscience_ - how genes are encoding, guiding, controling brain structures
* _Hebbian rule_ - "what fires together, wires together". Some mechanisms in brain are anti-Hebbian and some are neither. Overall, it is important model.
* Does model need to be accurate down to molecular level to understand cognition? Computational neuroscience says no, level of neurons and their connections might be sufficient
* There are a lot of recurrent loops in networks
* _Timing_ is very important, as a lot of processing and wiring are in _oscilating currents_
* There are different types of neurons
