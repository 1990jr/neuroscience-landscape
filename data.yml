              We reconstruct neuronal wiring diagrams by processing electron microscopic images that are sharp enough to reveal every brain cell in fantastic detail, including synapses and other organelles.
              Our computational pipeline applies multiple 3D convolutional nets to datasets as large as a petavoxel.
              We are applying our pipeline to accelerate research in neuroscience labs around the world.
              We are also a key player in BRAIN CONNECTS, one of the three transformative projects of the US BRAIN Initiative.
              BRAIN CONNECTS is an ambitious ten-year project to map a whole mouse brain at synaptic resolution, turning the dream of exascale connectomics into reality.
