              We reconstruct neuronal wiring diagrams by processing electron microscopic images that are sharp enough to reveal every brain cell in fantastic detail, including synapses and other organelles.
              Our computational pipeline applies multiple 3D convolutional nets to datasets as large as a petavoxel.
              We are applying our pipeline to accelerate research in neuroscience labs around the world.
              We are also a key player in BRAIN CONNECTS, one of the three transformative projects of the US BRAIN Initiative.
              BRAIN CONNECTS is an ambitious ten-year project to map a whole mouse brain at synaptic resolution, turning the dream of exascale connectomics into reality.

              other professionals and the general public to learn about, to share, to contribute to, and to advance the state of knowledge in computational neuroscience.
              Computational neuroscience combines mathematical analyses and computer simulations with experimental neuroscience, to develop a principled understanding 
              of the workings of nervous systems and apply it in a wide range of technologies.
              The Organization for Computational Neurosciences promotes meetings and courses in computational neuroscience and organizes the Annual CNS Meeting 
              which serves as a forum for young scientists to present their work and to interact with senior leaders in the field.

              During the 1982 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, which was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8 Korean neuroscientists got together 
              in a local restaurant and agreed to have annual gatherings of Korean neuroscientists at subsequent meetings of the Society.
              As the number of members in the Society for Neuroscience increased, the number of Korean neuroscientist members grew as well and
              more Korean neuroscientists attended the annual dinner meeting each year. 
              In 1988, at the Toronto, Canada meeting, bylaws were adopted (click here to view the bylaws) and the Association was formally founded.
              There have been well over 250 Korean neuroscientists in attendance at recent annual dinner meetings.

              and environments (liquids, solids and elastic matter with variable physical properties) developed for 
              simulations of C. elegans physical body dynamics within the OpenWorm project by Andrey Palyanov, Sergey Khayrulin and Mike Vella 
              (development of a Python module for external muscle activating signals generation and input) as part of the OpenWorm team. 
              At its core, Sibernetic is built as an extension to Predictive-Corrective Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (PCISPH). 
              It is primarily written in C++ and OpenCL, which makes possible to run simulations on CPUs or GPUs, and has 3D visualization support built on top of OpenGL.
