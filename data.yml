              We reconstruct neuronal wiring diagrams by processing electron microscopic images that are sharp enough to reveal every brain cell in fantastic detail, including synapses and other organelles.
              Our computational pipeline applies multiple 3D convolutional nets to datasets as large as a petavoxel.
              We are applying our pipeline to accelerate research in neuroscience labs around the world.
              We are also a key player in BRAIN CONNECTS, one of the three transformative projects of the US BRAIN Initiative.
              BRAIN CONNECTS is an ambitious ten-year project to map a whole mouse brain at synaptic resolution, turning the dream of exascale connectomics into reality.

              other professionals and the general public to learn about, to share, to contribute to, and to advance the state of knowledge in computational neuroscience.
              Computational neuroscience combines mathematical analyses and computer simulations with experimental neuroscience, to develop a principled understanding 
              of the workings of nervous systems and apply it in a wide range of technologies.
              The Organization for Computational Neurosciences promotes meetings and courses in computational neuroscience and organizes the Annual CNS Meeting 
              which serves as a forum for young scientists to present their work and to interact with senior leaders in the field.

              During the 1982 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, which was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8 Korean neuroscientists got together 
              in a local restaurant and agreed to have annual gatherings of Korean neuroscientists at subsequent meetings of the Society.
              As the number of members in the Society for Neuroscience increased, the number of Korean neuroscientist members grew as well and
              more Korean neuroscientists attended the annual dinner meeting each year. 
              In 1988, at the Toronto, Canada meeting, bylaws were adopted (click here to view the bylaws) and the Association was formally founded.
              There have been well over 250 Korean neuroscientists in attendance at recent annual dinner meetings.

              We pursue the hypothesis that computations are performed in the high dimensional dynamic state space provided by the non-linear dynamics that evolve in the recurrent network of delay coupled oscillatory circuits. Core assumptions are:
              i) information about statistical contingencies in natural scenes is contained in the weight distributions of recurrent connections and expressed in temporal correlations among the discharges of feature specific neurons;
              ii) information conveyed by top down projections as a function of attention and expectancy is also manifest in the correlation structure of distributed neuron populations and
              iii) if sensory evidence matches the predictions stored in the functional architecture of the recurrent networks and/or the expectancies conveyed by top down projections, network dynamics converge to states characterized by increased coherence (synchrony) and specific correlation patterns.
              To test the predictions of this conceptual framework we investigate population dynamics with cellular resolution by performing massive parallel recordings from the visual cortex of behaviourally trained monkeys with chronically implanted microelectrode arrays.

              This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D 
              intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models.
              The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of 
              over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. 
              Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns 
              within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

              offering a pioneering tool for understanding how our brain works and how to deal with its disorders like stroke, 
              epilepsy or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.
              While large-scale research initiatives simulate neurons and small brain regions at the cellular level on massively parallel hardware, 
              they are still years away from clinical applications.
              The Virtual Brain (TVB) takes a different approach and reduces complexity on the micro level to attain the macro organization: 
              a TVB model of a patient's brain generates sufficiently accurate EEG, MEG, BOLD and SEEG signals by reducing 
              the complexity millionfold through methods from statistical physics. The key is TVB's hybrid approach of merging individual anatomy 
              from brain imaging data with state-of-the-art mathematical modeling.
