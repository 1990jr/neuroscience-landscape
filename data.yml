              in a local restaurant and agreed to have annual gatherings of Korean neuroscientists at subsequent meetings of the Society.
              As the number of members in the Society for Neuroscience increased, the number of Korean neuroscientist members grew as well and
              more Korean neuroscientists attended the annual dinner meeting each year. 
              In 1988, at the Toronto, Canada meeting, bylaws were adopted (click here to view the bylaws) and the Association was formally founded.
              There have been well over 250 Korean neuroscientists in attendance at recent annual dinner meetings.

              We study the biological mechanisms underlying cognition from a network perspective.
              Brain networks span from the micro-scale of neurons and synapses to the macro-scale of long range connections between brain regions.
              We investigate how networks connect levels of organization in the brain and how they link structure to function. We also investigate pathophysiology and try to find treatment modalities of diseases that give perturbation to cognitive functions such as Alzheimer's disease.
              For these purposes, we mainly use in vivo imaging modalities such as two-photon microscopy, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, EEG and MRI.
              Images are obtained from human subjects and animal models to investigate how the integrative nature of brain function can be illuminated from a microlevel network to a large scale network.
              Through this we want to understand the higher cognitive functions of human brain (how the brain works) and to develop restoration, augmentation and modulation systems for patients with brain dysfunctions using current cutting-edge bioengineering techniques.

              The ultimate goal of the DECISION Brain Dynamics Laboratory in KAIST (PI: Prof. Jaeseung Jeong) is to understand the complex brain mechanism underlying decision-making and social cognition and their impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders.
              To achieve this goal, we use neuroimaging methods including EEG/fMRI and computational modeling tools to investigate how cortical-subcortical circuits work during decision-making and social cognition.
              We attempt to develop the integrative models of impaired cognitive processes in neuropsychiatric disorders and develop brain-computer
              Interface techniques for therapeutic neuromodulations of neuropsychiatric patients and robot-animal group controls.
              In addition, we study how the brain produces aesthetic preference on paintings and music and how it manipulates social communications between humans.

              Animals in the wild encounter many types of external stimuli such as threat and food,
              and must exhibit appropriate responses for survival. How does a brain recognize such
              stimuli with sensory systems, create internal representations of these external stimuli,
              and then elicit appropriate behavioral responses?
              To address this problem, we take systems approach and use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster,
              because of a wealth of genetic tools available, a relatively simple brain, and a complex, interesting
              behavioral repertoire. Rapidly emerging tools also permit relatively facile identification of neural
              substrates. We recently launched studies using mice in addition to fruit flies. Our focus has been to identify neurons that subserve a particular innate behavior, apply functional imaging and electro-
              physiology to probe their activity, therefore, define precisely contributions of each set of neurons
              to behavior. We are currently interested in identification and characterization of post-ingestive,
              internal sensors that detect the nutritional value of carbohydrate, fats and protein (macronutrients),
              and micronutrients in Drosophila. We are extending this line of work in mice to elucidate the
              identities and characteristics of the mammalian nutrient sensors, and understand the mechanisms
              by which these sensors contribute to feeding and metabolism. Among a number of discoveries that our laboratory has made thus far, we have contributed
              significantly to understanding the function of Glucose-sensing neurons in the brain. Glucose-sensing
              neurons were identified initially by electrophysiological recordings (Oomura et al., 1964 Science),
              but the physiological function mediated by these neurons in animals were unclear until recently.
              We have been able to elucidate their function using Drosophila: 1) the nutritional content of sugar,
              rather than its palatability, was detected by a discrete population of glucose-excited neurons (termed
              DH44 neurons) that promote sugar consumption (Dus et al., 2015 Neuron and 2011 PNAS, Oh et al., 2021 Neuron) and 2) a pair of glucose-excited neurons (termed CN neurons) regulate the two key endocrine axes: insulin and glucagon (Oh et al., 2019 Nature).
              These are a series of significant discoveries because approximately 10-15% of neurons in our brain are glucose-sensing, but it has taken over 50 years to reveal their physiological function in an animal.
              Understanding the functions of glucose-sensing in Drosophila would provide a foundation for studying their functions in mice and humans, and developing therapeutic potentials for health issues such as obesity, diabetes, eating disorders.
              In addition to the studies of glucose-sensing, we have identified and characterized neural circuits mediating the detection and response to the deprivation of amino acids (Kim et al., 2021 Nature), 
              and other macronutrients, as well as essential micronutrients (see a Review by Kim et al, 2021 Cell Metabolism).

            description: |
              How do we perceive the world? Inputs from the external world, i.e., sensory stimuli, need to be actively processed in the brain to be transformed into a "percept".
              Sensory processing (computation of sensory stimuli in the brain) is the gateway to sensory perception, and efficient sensory processing is required for the perceptual behavior of the animal.
              Switching from a drowsy, inattentive behavioral state to an aroused, the attentive state is crucial for the effective perception of relevant sensory stimuli and execution of cognitively demanding tasks.
              How do our brain circuits execute this amazing function? We answer this question by studying the following topics in the mouse animal model:
              - Modality-specific sensory processing;
              - Selective attention and modulation of perception;
              - Multisensory integration and cross-modal binding;
              - Perceptual decision and sensorimotor transformation;
              - Social perception;
              Our research aims to unravel brain circuits that are important for selective attention, multisensory integration, and behavioral decision, which are critical for cognitive and perceptual behaviors.
              Insights from our study should be broadly applicable to the treatment of cognitive disorders, including attention deficit disorder, autism, schizophrenia, and dementia.

              Our goal is to understand the neural mechanisms that support decision making and episodic memory. 
              We investigate how neural processes underlying these functions are implemented in the rodent brain by examining discharge characteristics of neuronal ensembles in behaving animals, by examining the effects of manipulating specific neural systems on animal behavior and neural activity, and by computational modeling.
              Neural basis of episodic memory.
              Notwithstanding intensive and extensive investigations for the past few decades, neural circuit mechanisms underlying hippocampal mnemonic processing are far from being clear.
              We have proposed a new model for hippocampal function—the binding-simulation-selection model—to account for new empirical findings and to make sense of why the hippocampus has evolved not only to remember but also to imagine episodes.
              Under this working hypothesis, we investigate how simulation-selection processes are implemented in CA3-CA1 networks, concentrating on value-dependent online and offline activities of hippocampal neurons and the role of dopamine in these processes.
              We also investigate hippocampal-neocortical interactions to understand how valuable sequences, that are selected by CA1, are stored as long-term memories in neocortical areas.
              Neural basis of decision making.
              Under the broad category of decision making, we investigate functional microcircuits in the frontal cortex underlying adaptive control of behavior.
              Specific topics include reward-based learning, value representation, value-dependent action selection, and working memory.
              We investigate how different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons embedded in the frontal cortex neural circuitry process and store information for flexible control of behavior in a way to maximize a long-term sum of rewards. 
              Neural basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
              We investigate how ASD symptoms might be linked to abnormalities in the hippocampal and frontal cortical neural processes.
              Specifically, we investigate how hippocampal and frontal cortical neural activity differs between wild-type and ASD model mice under diverse behavioral settings such as perceptual decision making and social interactions.

              We pursue the hypothesis that computations are performed in the high dimensional dynamic state space provided by the non-linear dynamics that evolve in the recurrent network of delay coupled oscillatory circuits. Core assumptions are:
              i) information about statistical contingencies in natural scenes is contained in the weight distributions of recurrent connections and expressed in temporal correlations among the discharges of feature specific neurons;
              ii) information conveyed by top down projections as a function of attention and expectancy is also manifest in the correlation structure of distributed neuron populations and
              iii) if sensory evidence matches the predictions stored in the functional architecture of the recurrent networks and/or the expectancies conveyed by top down projections, network dynamics converge to states characterized by increased coherence (synchrony) and specific correlation patterns.
              To test the predictions of this conceptual framework we investigate population dynamics with cellular resolution by performing massive parallel recordings from the visual cortex of behaviourally trained monkeys with chronically implanted microelectrode arrays.

              By probing the synaptic connections between nerve cells in the humble sea slug, 
              Eric Kandel has uncovered some of the basic molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory in animals ranging from snails to flies 
              to mice and even in humans. His groundbreaking studies have demonstrated the fundamental ways that nerve cells alter their response 
              to chemical signals to produce coordinated changes in behavior.
              This work is central to understanding not only normal memory but also dementia and other mental illnesses that affect memory.
              Kandel's research has shown that learning produces changes in behavior by modifying the strength of connections between nerve cells, 
              rather than by altering the brain's basic circuitry. He went on to determine the biochemical changes that accompany memory formation, 
              showing that short-term memory involves a functional modulation of the synapses while long-term memory requires the activation of genes and 
              the synthesis of proteins to grow new synaptic connections.
              For this work, the Austrian-born Kandel was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

              This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D 
              intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models.
              The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of 
              over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. 
              Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns 
              within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

            description: |
              Simulating the human brain is the holy grail of neuroscience - 
              offering a pioneering tool for understanding how our brain works and how to deal with its disorders like stroke, 
              epilepsy or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.
              While large-scale research initiatives simulate neurons and small brain regions at the cellular level on massively parallel hardware, 
              they are still years away from clinical applications.
              The Virtual Brain (TVB) takes a different approach and reduces complexity on the micro level to attain the macro organization: 
              a TVB model of a patient's brain generates sufficiently accurate EEG, MEG, BOLD and SEEG signals by reducing

              Almost any electrophysiology study of neural spiking data relies on a battery of standard analyses. 
              Raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms aligned to stimuli and behavior provide a snapshot visual description of neural activity.
              Similarly, tuning curves are the most standard way to characterize how neurons encode stimuli or behavioral preferences.
              With increasing popularity of population recordings, maximum-likelihood decoders based on tuning models are becoming part of this standard.
              Yet, virtually every lab relies on a set of in-house analysis scripts to go from raw data to summaries.
              We want to improve this status quo in order to enable easier sharing, better reproducibility and fewer bugs.
              Spykes is a collection of Python tools to make the visualization and analysis of neural data easy and reproducible.
